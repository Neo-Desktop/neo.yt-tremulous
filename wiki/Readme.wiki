This qvm was jointly developed for SST by Google and Paradox, with patches from many different people, mainly Lakitu7, Benmachine, Amanieu d'Antras, Rezyn, Google, and Paradox.

There is an info file included in the readme. This *MUST* be included with all installations of the QVM. Place it in the info directory where your admin.dat is held.
